#Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine-learning model that classifies individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on early medical indicators. The dataset used for this analysis is the Early Diabetes Classification Dataset from Kaggle, which includes key health features such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and insulin levels. The goal is to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes, providing a valuable tool for early intervention and risk assessment.

Objective

The main objectives of the project are:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather and clean the dataset to ensure it's suitable for model training.

Model Development: Apply various machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes status.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Libraries and Tools:
The following Python libraries are essential for model development and analysis:

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical operations.
Sklearn: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
Matplotlib: Data visualization.
Seaborn: Statistical data visualization.

---
Outcome: The goal is to develop a model which helps better understand the relationship between lifestyle and diabetes and help predict whether a patient has diabetes, is pre-diabetic or healthy.
