#Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine-learning model that classifies individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on early medical indicators. The dataset used for this analysis is the Early Diabetes Classification Dataset from Kaggle, which includes key health features such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and insulin levels. The goal is to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes, providing a valuable tool for early intervention and risk assessment.
